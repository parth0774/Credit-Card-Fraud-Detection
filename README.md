# Neural Network-Based Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Comprehensive Approach Using Machine Learning

**Abstract**

Credit card fraud has become a significant concern in the digital economy, resulting in substantial financial losses for both financial institutions and consumers. This research paper presents a comprehensive neural network-based approach to credit card fraud detection. We explore a dataset containing credit card transactions, employ various preprocessing techniques to handle class imbalance, and implement a deep learning model to effectively identify fraudulent transactions. Our experimental results demonstrate high accuracy and F1 scores, with particular emphasis on the balance between precision and recall. The paper details the methodology, justifies the choice of techniques, analyzes results, and discusses implications for real-world application.
